# course_project
It is a repository for my course in Uppsala University.

This program analyze the correlation from time-series data of several power system analysis input: residential load consumption, EV charging consumption, and PV generation.

The output of this program is: 1) intra-variable correlation, the correlation between houses of the same type input variables, i.e., load-load, EV-EV, EV-PV. 2) inter-variable correlation, the correlation of different type of input variables within a same house i.e., load-EV, load-PV, EV-PV.
